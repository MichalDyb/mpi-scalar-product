# mpi-scalar-product

A program written in the C language that computes the dot product of n-element real vectors. The program uses the architecture of the MPI environment.
• For an environment where there is no interruption between processes
• For the environment in the relationship between the processes (processors), the help was introduced using the MPI_Graph_Create function, and the specific structure is in the form of a ring (Hypercube d = 3 architecture)
